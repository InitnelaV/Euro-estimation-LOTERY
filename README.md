A script generating the probabilities of results in the European lottery (called EuroMillions in France, but known under different names across Europe).

It should incrementally add the results of the Tuesday and Friday draws to the list and remove the oldest ones, as the estimation will be based on the last 12 months.

I haven't been able to extract data from a CSV edited by the FDJ (Fédération Française des loteries) yet.

 <balise br/>--BEGIN UPDATE---
The V2 include the import .csv data.
You can find the results here https://www.fdj.fr/jeux-de-tirage/euromillions-my-million/historique?msockid=19e4fa7c7bfc69c70b3deeaf7aa1688c
When you DL, the .zip, extract the .csv, then, keep andformat your file in 7 columns
boule_1	boule_2	boule_3	boule_4	boule_5	etoile_1	etoile_2
---END OF UPDATE---
Enjoy

---WARNING---
This script is used to calculate probabilities and does not in any way reflect the draw or the final result. Predicting with 100% accuracy would be divine or quantum... You will not win anything by playing these numbers. Like alcohol, the abuse of gambling is harmful to oneself and one's surroundings
