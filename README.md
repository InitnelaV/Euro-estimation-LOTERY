A script generating the probabilities of results in the European lottery (called EuroMillions in France, but known under different names across Europe).

It should incrementally add the results of the Tuesday and Friday draws to the list and remove the oldest ones, as the estimation will be based on the last 12 months.

I haven't been able to extract data from a CSV edited by the FDJ (Fédération Française des loteries) yet.
